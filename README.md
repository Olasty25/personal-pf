## About The Project

This portfolio was built from the ground up to be more than just a static page; it's a reflection of my passion for clean code, user-centric design, and powerful technologies. The goal was to create a sleek, modern, and engaging experience for visitors, whether they are potential clients, employers, or fellow developers.

The design is inspired by modern dark-mode aesthetics, focusing on clarity, elegant typography, and interactive elements that bring the content to life.

## ✨ Key Features

-   **Sleek, Modern Design:** A clean and professional UI with a dark theme that's easy on the eyes.
-   **Fully Responsive:** Perfect viewing experience on all devices, from mobile phones to widescreen desktops.
-   **Multi-Language Support:** Fully functional English (EN) and Polish (PL) translations, with the user's preference saved locally.
-   **Dynamic Project Previews:** Engaging project showcase section, designed to support video previews for a "live" feel.
-   **Interactive UI/UX:** Smooth hover effects, transitions, and a clear call-to-action to encourage contact.
-   **Pure Vanilla JS:** Built with clean, efficient, and dependency-free JavaScript for fast performance.
