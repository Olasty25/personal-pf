## About The Project

This portfolio was built from the ground up to be more than just a static page; it's a reflection of my passion for clean code, user-centric design, and powerful technologies. The goal was to create a sleek, modern, and engaging experience for visitors, whether they are potential clients, employers, or fellow developers.

The design is inspired by modern dark-mode aesthetics, focusing on clarity, elegant typography, and interactive elements that bring the content to life.

## üîß Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You only need a modern web browser.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
